# zaef20b

Code for reproducing the experiments described in the paper "Continuous Optimization Benchmarks by Simulation" by Zaefferer and Rehbach.
See comments in provided files for details. 

Note, that an easier accessible version of the provided methods is available via https://github.com/martinzaefferer/COBBS

The difference: zaef20b repository is only intend for exact reproduction. The COBBS repository provides explanations and easier accessible interfaces (but does not reproduce the performed experiments exactly).

In addition, the "completeRibbonPlot.pdf" shows the complete set of figures representing the error of algorithm performances produced by the different test functions. The paper only shows a subset of these. The first page shows performance errors for Differential Evolution, the second shows Random Search, and the last shows Nelder Mead.
